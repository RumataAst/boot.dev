# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project



Books can be downloaded with wget -O command for example :
wget -O books/mobydick.txt https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/mobydick.txt
wget -O books/prideandprejudice.txt https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/prideandprejudice.txt


The program requires the following input python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
